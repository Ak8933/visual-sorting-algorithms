Sorting is an integral operation in the world of Computer Science.  
This project aims to visually distinguish amongst various sorting algorithms in Python.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- The program will run without any issues on any computer, but for a smooth performance, it is recommended to use a system with atleast 4 GB memory, and atleast 2 CPU cores.
- Python must be installed.
- You can use git to clone the repository, or you can download the zip file.

### Basic Setup

##### a. If you have Python installed

- Start the app with the following commands.

```
python3 main.py
```



### Technologies Used

- All the visuals were built solely using ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-%2314354C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white) 
- [**Tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/) were the libraries used to create the visuals of the project.
